# Contributing to PyPlanet core.

All the changes you want to contribute must be from either a ticket or a different feature pull request. Make sure you contribute the pull and issues on our Github 
repository at our Main Repo.
All contributions are welcome.

## Bugfixing, feature, apps, etc.

If you just want to report an issue or suggestion, go ahead, please describe it as much as possible eventually with screenshots.

Please send a pull request to the master branch. 
Please include a documentation update and update or add tests for your changes.

- Fork the PyPlanet repository.
- Create a separate branch from master.
- Develop fixes, features, apps, tests, update documentation, etc
- Run the test suite on at least Python 3.6 or higher.
- Create a pull request, after creating the test suites will start from Travis CI. We can only merge once they are complete and succeeded!

### Guidelines

- Separate code commits from reformatting commits.
- Please provide comments in your code and use docblocks.
- Provide tests for any newly added code.
- Follow PEP8 as much as possible.
- When committing non-code changes, please include [ci skip] in the commit message to avoid running tests on Travis-CI.

## Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, please include code that reproduces the issue and whenever possible, an image that demonstrates the issue. The best reproductions are self-contained scripts with minimal dependencies.

### Provide details

- What did you do?
- What did you expect to happen?
- What actually happened?
- What versions of PyPlanet, the apps you have installed, and Python are you using?
